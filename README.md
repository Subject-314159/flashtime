# Flashtime

> In Flashtime, the world slows to a crawl while I move at normal speed, letting me react and act with perfect precision. Everything else is frozen, giving me the edge to control the situation.

        - The Flash, probably

Enter flashtime by clicking the shortcut button or by pressing `Alt + F`
